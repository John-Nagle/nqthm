# nqthm
nqthm - the original Boyer-Moore theorem prover, from 1992

This is the original Boyer-Moore theorem prover, developed from 1972 to 1992.
The sources for this program were last revised in 1992, and can be found here:

ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/boyer/nqthm/index.html

With very minor modifications, the program can be run under GNU clisp.
This repository is to contain a version runnable today.

This program is primarily of historical interest as a milestone in 
logic-based artificial intelligence.  New work in this area should use
the newer ACL2 theorem prover, also by Boyer and Moore.
