This is the `README' file for the `examples' subdirectory of Nqthm-1992, a
collection of subdirectories of over one hundred event files, which together
contain thousands of theorems.  This file also reflects the result of
installing the additional Nqthm examples that were distributed in 1995.

No file on this directory `examples', nor on any of its subdirectories, is
necessary for the compilation, installation, or execution of Nqthm-1992.

In the subdirectories such as basic, bevier, bronstein, cowles, flatau,
fm9001-piton, fortran-vcg, hunt, kaufmann, kunen numbers, shankar, talcott,
subramanian, young, and yu are the *.events files, the actual example files.

There are a variety of ways to replay these examples.  Please note that to
replay all these examples is a data processing activity requiring nontrivial
time and space resources -- perhaps as much as three hundred megabytes of disk
space, one hundred megabytes of virtual memory, and, on a fast workstation of
1997, 9 hours of cpu time.  See further warnings about resources in the file
`driver.lisp'.

Alternative 1.  From within a Common Lisp into which the compiled files for
Nqthm-1992 have been loaded, simply invoke, say, (prove-file-out "ex"), to
check an example file named, say, `ex.events'.  Before invoking prove-file-out,
one must indicate the directory of the file `ex.events', either (1) by using
some operating-system-specific or Common-Lisp-implementation-specific command
such as `cd' or (2) by setting *DEFAULT-NQTHM-PATH* to some suitable pathname
string, e.g. "/local/src/nqthm-1992/examples/basic/".  Obviously, the choice of
the directory name depends upon where the Nqthm-1992 examples are located at
your site.  If the checking is successful, a file `ex.proved' will be created.
If unsuccessful, `ex.proved' will not be created, but a file `ex.proofs' may
contain an error message and, in all likelihood, files named `ex.STARTED' or
`ex.fail' will be created.  Because some example files start with instructions
to call `note-lib' to load information dumped after checking other example
files, the order in which examples are done is important.  An example file that
starts with a `boot-strap' does not depend on another file.  The drawback to
running the examples in this way, via explicit calls to prove-file-out, is that
it is tedious to do each by hand, since there are over a hundred.  The
remaining alternatives listed below automate the invocation of prove-file on
each of the examples.  However, these other alternatives necessarily involve
operating-system-specific and Common-Lisp-implementation-specific code that
will not work for some systems.

Alternative 2.  Load the file `driver.lisp' into a Common Lisp containing a
compiled Nqthm-1992.  See that file for further directions; in particular it is
necessary to set up certain directory variables; the file `dir.lisp' contains
typical example settings of variables that point to directories for use when
running `driver.lisp'.  There are two drawbacks to this `driver.lisp'
alternative.  First, because `driver.lisp' contains instructions for switching
between the various example directories, and because we know of no method to do
this in general in all Common Lisps, this method will fail for any operating
system in which subdirectory components of file names are not separated by a
single character, e.g., the character "/" in Unix.  If a single character is
not so used in your operating system, you will find it necessary to edit
suitably the definition of DRIVER-PROVE-FILE-OUT in the file `driver.lisp'.
Second, some of the examples are so large that they will not execute for want
of sufficient heap in the default configurations of some Common Lisps.

Alternative 3. Invoke either the command `make giant-test' or else the command
`make giant-test-alt' at the Unix csh level while connected to the directory
above this, i.e., nqthm-1992.  Do this after successfully running the command
`make LISP=xxx', where xxx is the the command to run your LISP.  This works for
AKCL, Allegro, CMU, and Lucid Common Lisps.  The difference between giant-test
and giant-test-alt is that the former does all of the tests in a single Lisp
process whereas the latter does each test in a different process.

DEFN-SK.  In the spirit of `driver.lisp', the file `driver-sk.lisp' can be
loaded into Nqthm-1992 to check the three example files that use defn-sk, Matt
Kaufmann's Skolemizer, which we distribute with Nqthm-1992.

Historical note.  The Nqthm-1987 events that used to be in the single file
`basic.events', as documented in `A Computational Logic Handbook,' first
edition, may now be found in the subdirectories `basic' and `shankar'.  The
events file `fm8501.events' may be found in the subdirectory `hunt'.  The
events file `goedel.events' may be found in the subdirectory `shankar'.
