The files in this directory are the work of Yuan Yu.

In the following, the notation "requires DEFN-SK" means that it is necessary to
load the file defn-sk.lisp, Matt Kaufmann's skolemizer, into Nqthm, e.g., with
the command (load "defn-sk.lisp"), before processing a particular file.  The
file defn-sk.lisp is distributed with Nqthm-1992, but it is not loaded via the
standard load command (load-nqthm).

                           BSD UNIX C STRING LIBRARY

Verification of MC68020 machine code of 21 of the 22 C String Library functions
from the Berkeley Unix C String Library, namely all the functions except
strerror, which is specified to "return pointer to implementation-defined
string corresponding to error n"; left out of Yu's work because of this
implementation dependence.

Subject: events files


I have created a directory ~yuan/mc20/ on cs that contains all the events
files in my dissertation.  They have been successfully replayed.  You
may choose any of them to include in the nqthm-1992 release.

Thanks,
