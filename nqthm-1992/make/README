This directory contains Lisp code that is used only to help build Nqthm-1992
under Unix via the `make' command.  It is not only possible but even easy to
install Nqthm-1992 without using the `make' command or anything on this
directory.

Unlike the sources for Nqthm-1992, the code here is Common Lisp implementation
dependent.  Why do we write any Common Lisp implementation dependent code at
all?  Example answers are that the Common Lisp specification does not say how
to (a) save an executable image, (b) `work around' bugs or deliberate errors in
Common Lisp implementations, (d) get the fastest compilation settings for a
particular Lisp, (e) suppress irrelevant compiler warnings, (f) request more
heap than comes by default, (g) arrange for the evaluation of a form at the
start of a user interrupt, (h) arrange to suppress optional compiler commentary
of emense proportions, or (i) suppress unwanted garbage collection or function
redefinition messages.

It should be recognized that although there is perhaps some justification for
writing implementation dependent code, it is not unlikely that this code will
break in future releases of the Lisps for which it was intended.  If this code
does not work for you, you are advised not to use the `make' command to build
Nqthm-1992 command, but instead to use the simpler instructions for Nqthm-1992
installation found in the main README file.
