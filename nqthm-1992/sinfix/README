INSTALLATION

The files required are:

 sinfix.lisp
 latex-init.lisp
 latex-theory.lisp
 scribe-init.lisp
 scribe-theory.lisp
 akcl-patch.lisp ***

*** With AKCL version 1.615 (and earlier, presumably), a patch file
must be loaded before the -init files can be compiled.  Sinfix.lisp
makes this load conditional on a feature check for akcl.

 #+akcl (load-base "akcl-patch.lisp")

LOAD-BASE looks for the file in the *infix-directory* directory.  See
below.

For decent speed, sinfix and the -init files should be compiled.
With AKCL that means producing the files:

 sinfix.o
 latex-init.o
 scribe-init.o

After compiling Nqthm, connect to the directory in which the sinfix
sources reside, start up Nqthm, compile sinfix.lisp, load sinfix.o
and then compile the *-init.lisp files.  Starting out in the directory
in which sinfix resides causes *infix-directory* to get set properly.

By default, sinfix expects the scribe-theory and latex-theory files to
be in *infix-directory*.  And they in turn expect their corresponding
-init files to be there also.  This is the directory in which you
should compile sinfix.lisp (the value of (probe-file "./") at compile
time).  If you want to put these files elsewhere or want to compile
the system from some other directory, edit sinfix.lisp before
compiling it for your system.  Find and change:

 (defparameter *infix-directory* #.(namestring (probe-file "./")))

It is the first defparameter in the file.  The `#.' causes the
(namestring (probe-file ..)) to be evaluated at compile time.  The
resulting value gets assigned at load time.

Other -theory files may reside in *infix-directory* or in the `current
directory' (defined to be the directory returned by (probe-file "./")
at execution time).  The current directory is checked first.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
USE

The simple way to run this program is to connect to the directory
containing your .events files, start up nqthm-1992, and load sinfix.o.

The basic call is then 

  (infix-file <file> :mode <mode>) 

where <file> is the name (without type) of a .events file and, in the
simplest case, <mode> is one of "scribe" or "latex".  For example:

  (infix-file "clock" :mode "scribe") 

See the documentation in sinfix.lisp for information on user
parameterization and extension of modes.  In particular, see the
section `SETTINGS THAT MAY BE MODIFIED IN MODE-THEORY.LISP'.

Just as a note, if you have an events file, say clock.events, and
create a corresponding theory file, clock-theory.lisp, then you can
use the even simpler invocation:

  (infix-file "clock")

TESTING

SinFix has been tested in both Scribe and LaTeX mode against the files
in "/slocal/src/nqthm-1992/examples/*/*.events".
